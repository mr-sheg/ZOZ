# Zotero Obsidian Zettelkasten

This repository presents my current Zettelkasten workflow based on the use of two softwares : Obsidian and Zotero.

Zettelkasten (german for 'slip box') is a note-taking and personal knowledge management method that is frequently associated with great success in science, research, study and writing (see [Nicklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann)). Obsidian is a free (but proprietary) _knowledge base/note-taking_ software, while Zotero is a free and open-source reference management software. In other words, Zotero is the software I use to create my digital library of references, articles and books (basically a bank of .pdf and .html files). On the other hand, Obsidian is where I take note, capture thoughts, write ideas and organize everything else. It is also where you will create and visualize graphs of linked ideas and expand your knowledge base.

Many have already presented Zettelkasten workflows similar to what you will find here, and I don't pretend to have created anything original regarding the method of Zettelkasten, Obsidian or Zotero, far from it. As such, I will try and add the references I found and used as they come up and list everything in the [[]] section. However, I thought many could use this written guide to set-up the workflow for themselves and I wanted to share the Zotero Custom Import template I use (see ). Creating this template is not trivial if you are not already familiar with the ins and outs of obsidian or are not willing to do a bit of _coding_ yourself (I consent to use the word _coding_ quite liberally).
